            <p>William Whitney: Let’s start by discussing your drawing practice. You’re always drawing.</p> 

            <p>Stanley Whitney: Absolutely, I draw all the time. Drawing kind of keeps you young as a painter. Drawing keeps you dealing with a lot of possibilities. It keeps you fresh. I think every artist has to reinvent drawing. I liked Matisse’s drawing and Van Gogh’s drawing, because that’s the kind of painter I am. The idea of the line and the mark having a lot of power. </p>

            <p>WW: What’s always fascinated me about your drawings is the intensity and richness of the lines in your work given the absence of color.</p>
            
            <p>SW: You look at those Matisse drawings of just the head with one line and they’re just as powerful as the paintings. The power of lines. I’m always looking for the power of an expressive line in terms of drawing. If I make a black and white drawing, that’s very colorful to me. And then in terms of writing things down, Always Running from the Police came out of that Biggie Smalls and 2Pac song, which I really like. A lot of times I’m listening to music and something sticks with me. I have music in my head all the time. If I’m riding a bike, I sing all the time. I’ll be drawing and I’ll think ‘oh that sounds really good’ or ‘I like that’ or ‘this is really good and important’. The sketches like that [No To Prison Life and Always Running from the Police], now they’re becoming really public. But they weren’t always meant to be public. It’s something that I just do for myself. There’s a lot of things I have in sketchbooks that I don’t want people to see. But all these things, they’re all things that feed me. I am a very political person, as an African-American you’re forced to be political. Really, I don’t know how you could not be, living in America. When I was a kid, I was always running from the police. When I went to school in Kansas City, I was stopped every day. I didn’t tell anyone because I thought it was normal. In Philadelphia, we got stopped all the time. I never went out without my ID, never. You always had to have your ID, otherwise you could go to jail. When I used to go to Philadelphia as a ten-year old, we’d get off the train and be stopped immediately.</p>
