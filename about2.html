            Lisson Gallery was founded in 1967 by Nicholas Logsdail. It was one of a small number of pioneering galleries in the UK, Europe and the United
States to champion a generation of artists who were transforming the way art was made and presented, focusing on the idea or concept behind an
artwork over expressive or descriptive aims. These young artists – including Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold, Dan Graham, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin,
Carl Andre, Lawrence Weiner, Art & Language, John Latham, Peter Joseph, Lee Ufan, Giulio Paolini, Daniel Buren - represented not a style but an
attitude, an ethos concerning art’s place in a wider intellectual, cultural and social context.— The Art Newspaper interview by Anna Somers Cocks
October 2008.
